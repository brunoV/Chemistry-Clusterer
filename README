NAME
    Chemistry::Clusterer - Cluster spatial variants of macromolecular
    structures

VERSION
    version 0.100870

SYNOPSIS
       use Chemistry::Clusterer;

       my $clusterer = Chemistry::Clusterer->new(
           structures      => \@structures,
           grouping_method => { number => 10 },

       );

       say $clusterer->error;
       say $clusterer->cluster_count;

       foreach my $cluster ( @{ $clusterer->clusters } ) {
           say $cluster->size;
           say $cluster->centroid->coords;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a means for clustering or grouping a collection of
    structural/spacial variants of a macromolecular structure according to
    their RMSD values. This helps reduce the complexity of the collection by
    grouping together similar representations into clusters, which can be
    then analyzed as a single entity.

    The CPU intensive parts are done with the C Clustering library, by means
    of the Algorithm::Cluster module.

ATTRIBUTES
  structures
    An array reference of Chemistry::Clusterer::Structure entities. You can
    also provide an array reference of opened filehandles of each of the
    structures, or a string with the contents of the PDB file of each
    structure.

    Required.

  grouping_method
    The criteria with which to choose the desired number of clusters.
    Default is "distance => 5".

    options are:

   distance
        grouping_method => { distance => $d }

    The final number of clusters will be chosen so that the average distance
    between the centroids of the members of a single cluster is less or
    equal to $d Angstroms. In other words, it's the average radius of the
    sphere that contains all centroids of each cluster.

   number
        grouping_method => { number => $n }

    Simply select the exact number of clusters you want.

  coordinates_from
    Defines what subset of atoms to use for the clustering.

    It's a Chemistry::Clusterer::CoordExtractor object that extracts the
    coordinates of the desired atoms from each of the structures.

    By default it uses coordinates from alpha carbons, using
    Chemistry::Clusterer::CoordExtractor::AtomType.

    If you wanted to also use the coordinates of, say, the rest of carbon
    atoms, you'd say:

        coordinates_from => { atom_type => ['CA', 'C'] };

    The key of the hash reference selects which coordinate extractor to use,
    in this case "AtomType". The value is an array reference with the atom
    types to extract their coordinates from.

    Other extractor classes to use are
    Chemistry::Clusterer::CoordExtractor::Chain, which selects all atoms of
    a given chain, and Chemistry::Clusterer::CoordExtractor::All, which
    simply uses all atoms.

    For instance:

        coordinates_from => { chain => ['A', 'B'] };

        coordinates_from => 'all'; # same as { all => [ undef ] };

  clusters
    An array reference of Chemistry::Clusterer::Cluster entities, each
    representing a single cluster. It is lazily computed upon request.

METHODS
  structure_count
    Returns the total number of structures used for clustering.

  cluster_count
    The total number of clusters

  error
    The total clustering error
