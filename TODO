* Add an option to align all structures before clustering
* Accept Chemistry::Mol and, if I feel like it, Bio::Structure objects
* Maybe parse the header in PDB files, and attach it to the Structure
* Make the coordinate extractor composable, so that you can do
    coordinate_extractor => [ { atom_type => ['CA'], chain => ['A'] ];
