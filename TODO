* Input file format flexibility

    have a parser attribute with a delegate object for parsing. Defaulting to a
    custom pdb parser 'pdb'. Optionally, other file formats,
    Chemistry::MacroMol and Bio::Structure parsers. They should all consume a
    'parser' role.

    Make it pluggable in the sense that the user should just say the name, and
    it will look in the appropriate namespace and load that module.

* Accept Chemistry::Mol and, if I feel like it, Bio::Structure objects
* Add an option to align all structures before clustering
* Maybe parse the header in PDB files, and attach it to the Structure
